# Greenhouse_Automation
## Goal of the Project
Monitor temperature, soil moisture level, light intensity, and if there is water in the tank.
Control the temperature using a fan and heater and control the moisture level of soil with a pump and water tank
Warn user if there is an extreme condition that is out of control.
## Hardware (Prototype)
**Controller:** Arduino Mega 2560
**Light Sensor** 
**Water Sensor** 
**Temperature Sensor**
**Soil Moisture Sensor**

More detail will be added soon ...
